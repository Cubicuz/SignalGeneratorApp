# SignalGeneratorApp
the idea and initial code is from a university project of a fellow student and me. 
I start here again from scratch because i didn't backup the final version, lets see how long the motivation lasts.

Goal is to have a Signal Generator which can be manipulated by the internal Sensors. 
Maybe allow multiple Device setups with mqtt

i use jsyn for doing the audio part so i only have to do the interface
